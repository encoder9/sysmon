System Monitor - Created by Bradley J. Gibby

This project was created so that I could have a Dashboard with all my vital server information in one display.

Other projects would service this need but their level of dependancy on other software, their set up and configuration rules were far to complex.

sysmon was created so that anyone could dump this on their system and with very little set up, have all their vital information available to them.
